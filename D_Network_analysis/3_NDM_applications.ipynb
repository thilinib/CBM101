    "Network-based proximities between nodes can be used for a wide-range of applications including identifying disease-disease relationships, drug efficacy screening, drug repurposing, and drug combination identification. Simply put, the distances between the nodes or groups of nodes representing disease genes or drug targets within a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network can be used to identify which two diseases are pathobiologically similar or if a drug already approved for one disease can be used for another disease. While distances between any two individual nodes in a network can be easily calulated as the shortest path between them, there might be different ways how we define distances or network proximity between groups of nodes. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we focus on a series of studies from <a href=\"https://www.barabasilab.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Barabasi-LAB</a> that utilized network-based proximities in network medicine. In their works, Barabasi's group has explored five different types of network-based proximity measures between genesets or modules within a PPI network. The different network-based proximity measures are explained below.\n",
