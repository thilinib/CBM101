By now, you know a bit about programming. Hopefully, during the course you become motivated to learn more and start writing code yourself! That is how many R and Python libraries got developed - researchers with a specific task in mind developed code that can handle data collected in their study and address the data analysis questions that motivated the project.

Many such computational methods are nowadays developed as open-source projects that use Github (or similar code repositories) to host, share and develop the code. Git refers to an open-source version control system created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. It was created to help developers track and manage changes to a software projectâ€™s code.
