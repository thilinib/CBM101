### Using functions

Functions allow you to perform specific tasks. That means, they have been developed to be applicably to specific type of data, possibly allowing the user to specify additional parameters that control for example what is returned.

Let us look at a simple example (written in R)

input1 = 20
input2 = 10

mySum = function(input1, input2) {
   output =input1 + input2
   return(output)
}

In this example we define two input objects, input1 and input2, and set their values to 20 and 10, respectively.

Then we define a new function that has two parameters, specified inside the brackets (input1,input2).

What the function does, is specified inside the { } brackets. The function will generate a new object (output) that will get the value corresponding to the sum of the two input parameters. Then that sum is returned (function output).

Now we can use our function:

result = mySum(input1, input2)

Can you guess what will be the value of result?

### I got an error message !

What happens if we would use a wrong type of input? Say, we would try to use this function with

input1 = "Hello world!"

This would result in an error message, since sum is not defined for character string objects. For this reason, it is always important to check the description of the function you use. Make sure you understand what input parameters the function requires, and what type of objects those are.
