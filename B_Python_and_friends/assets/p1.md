When you program, essentially you ask the computer to perform different tasks. For example, the function below

print("Hello Universe")

would result in the quoted text to be shown. Similarly, you can use functions to perform mathematical operations, or search for matches within text, to name a few more examples. Both Python and R already have quite a few of the functions built-in that are ready to use immediately as you start Python (or R).

Alternatively, you can load functions from repositories:

* R has the repository CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network) containing thousands of libraries and R/Bioconductor is a special repository that is especially useful for biomedicine

* PiPy contains modules such as NumPy for advanced mathematical functionalities, Pandas for processing data in tables and Matplotlib for plotting graphs like histograms and scatter plots. We will look at some of these later.

### Key things to know about Python

Python was created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991. It is a general-purpose open-source programming language and relative easy to learn, making it at very beginner-friendly language.

The code repositories mentioned above are a valuable resource to get started - essentially they make available files made up of Python code that let you skip the process of coding many useful functions yourself. You simply import the modules at the beginning of your script and call the functions when needed.
