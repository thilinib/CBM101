A biologist will often turn to computer programming in situations where the amount or the complexity of data is too much to be senisibly hanled by spreadsheets, and where no other, more specialized, software exists. Often only a relative simple program needs to be written to get something useful from biological data, which would otherwise not be available.\n>\n> For biologists, the task of writing a computer program can sometimes seem like a significant barrier, but once the basic programming skills are learned then many possibilities are enabled. [Python](https://www.python.org) is one of the most popular programming languages and is becoming an increasingly attractive options for the biologist. It is a high-level, general-purpose language that is well supported and relatively easy to learn. Also, it has a large number of eternal modules, including many related to mathematics, science and biology. Python is easy to install and runs on almost all kinds of computer system. Presently, Python 3 is the _de facto_ standard.\n>\n> Even if you don't intend to use Python in the long-run or for all programming work [in some cases [R](https://www.r-project.org) could be an alternative], it nonetheless serves as a good starting point to learn some of the major principles of many modern computing languages.","block_group":"d302ccff57a14261a81d6d3356dbd752"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"tags":["style-activity"],"deepnote_cell_height":62,"deepnote_app_coordinates":{"h":5,"w":12,"x":0,"y":0},"cell_id":"4c83d9ba4a414e24bfb75d5f96114254","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"},"source":"### How to use this notebook:","block_group":"d820d742f33641df91bb8f8ad52d9f11"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"deepnote_cell_height":97.171875,"deepnote_app_coordinates":{"h":5,"w":12,"x":0,"y":0},"cell_id":"bc235591b7ac43f591b15fbb48a3221c","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"},"source":"This is a very detailed, and at times advanced introduction to Python, and it is unrealistic to get through it in a single go.
