# Why learn to program?

If you are working with large datasets, these skills can be really valuable. You can use a programming language for retrieving specific results from large data files, utilize statistical data analysis and machine learning code repositories to perform comparisons between sample groups and train models, or create elegant visualizations to summarize your findings. Two of the most widely used programming languages in the field of biomedical data analysis are Python and R.

In this course the main part of exercises are done in Python, except those under Biostatistics. The rationale to include these is that R was originally developed by statistical scientists and therefore contains a lot of features related to statistical modelling, statistical analysis of large data sets and data visualisation. Python on the other hand is claimed to be more useful for development of new applications and easier to use for beginners. Maybe because you do not need to know (or learn) a lot about biostatistics at the same time ;-) ?

However, similarly as in natural languages, there are certain common elements and learning one language makes it easier to get fluent in more. 

### Basic elements that are common to different programming languages  

In this module, you will test in practice:

* Data Types
* Variables and Objects
* Logical and Arithmetical Operators
* If else conditions
* Loops
* Numbers, Characters and Arrays
* Functions
* Input and Output Operations

### Learning to code with Jupyter notebook exercises

Notebooks are interactive documents that allow you to write using programming languages - to code - as well as include normal text and pictures to document your work. The strength of using such notebooks for an online course is that we as teachers can present some code snippets, scripts, for you that you can run (execute) in your notebook. By doing so, you can see the effect of the code (from simple math to more complex operations on data) directly in the document. Each code and text piece is placed in boxes/cells in the document.

### Open science

One topic that we will also cover in this module is a short overview of code development and sharing code via repositories. You probably already used Github to retrieve all the course materials. In the bigger picture, sharing analysis code and software is a key element in reproducible research.

### Module materials

If everything above is new to you, we have included some basic background theory and Python exercises to this course module. Use the links at the bottom to go over the starting material that is designed to help you proceed to the Notebook exercises. 

To get fluent, we recommend that you enroll to a more extensive programming basic course! In case you would be interested to test building code using the same basic elements in R, here are some suggestions: For those who are familiar with command line (yes, nerds) this <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Lemon-kickstart/"> kickstart </a> is a good place to get started with R. However, there is also an R package called <a href="https://swirlstats.com/students.html"> swirl </a> that will teach you R using R (go over at least the R programming course, it is short, concise and you learn the basic commands and logic of R).
