    "The dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://https://www.kaggle.com/), a popular platform for data science competitions and projects.\n",

    "The dataset contains various attributes or features associated with individuals, particularly from India, who have been diagnosed as either diabetic or non-diabetic. Each row typically represents one individual, and each column represents a specific attribute or feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original objective of the dataset is to diagnostically **predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements** included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.\n",
